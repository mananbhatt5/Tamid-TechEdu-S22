# Homework 4 #
***Due April 13th at 11:59 PM***
So now everyone is comfortable with Pandas and NumPy. It is time we take our understanding of Python, Pandas, and Data Cleaning to the next level.

### Setup ###
Download a dataset off of Kaggle just like last week (you can also use the same dataset from last week). We want our datasets nice and large - the larger the dataset the more cleaning we can do!

We are going to do ```git pull``` again in the Tamid-TechEdu-S22 directory just to update the repository. Then ```cd Week5``` to be in the current folder. You should see the README and Week 5 Code in there.

Make sure the downloaded CSV file is in the Week5 folder, then you are ready to code!

### Clean The Data Set ###
Now our next step is to just clean the s#@t out of this dataset! I will let you clean at your own will, but the only requirement is that you get your number of rows down to **1/4 of the original size!**

That's it! I am expecting a lot of cleaning. Save your new dataframe using ```df.to_csv('filename.csv')```

### Submitting ###
Same process as usual.
1. Add your file to your private branch with ```git add filename.ipynb``` and ```git add filename.csv```. Submit your old csv, new csv, and ipynb file.
2. Commit your changes to the master branch by doing ```git commit -m "Message"```.
3. Lastly, push your changes to the public repo by doing ```git push```. 

If you have any issues, please slack Sam or I, and we will help you out. Good luck, and get it done!
