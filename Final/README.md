# Final Project #
***Due April 24th at 5 PM***

Congratulations, you have reached the home stretch of our Tamid Tech Edu course! You guys have been incredible so far, but now it is time to create a project using an amalgamation of everything you have learned and put your skills to the REAL test. Everything you have learned so far is fair game. Good luck, and start early!

### Step 0: Setup ###
In the main directory for this class, do ```git pull``` then ```cd Final```. From there make your .ipynb file and you are good to go.

### Step 0.5: Markdowns ###
At the top of your file, open a Markdown cell and make a heading for a title of your project. Put a subtitle underneath for your group members' name. After each step, make a markdown to explain your thought process for your code. You can find a markdown syntax guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). 

### Step 1: Data Collection ###
With your partner, go on Google Firebase and make a database of AT LEAST 30 children (labeled 0-29) and variables within. This is the most time consuming part of the project. Make sure you have numerical values in your database so you can do Visualizing and Regressions. This is very important.

### Step 2: Data Processing ###
Export your database as a JSON and read it into your program. Convert the JSON to CSV and make a dataframe out of it.

### Step 3: Data Integration ###
This step involves cleaning and altering your dataframe to have everything you want in your dataframe. You don't have to do TOO much cleaning since you made the dataframe. Just be careful with what you do.

### Step 4: Data Visualization ###
Create at least 2 graphs for the visualization. One of them MUST be a scatterplot with a line of best fit. The others can be decided by doing plots with the Python Graph Gallery. Be very specific why you chose the graphs you did.

### Step 5: Data Validation ###
Create a null and alternate hypothesis based on your graphs in step 4 and use an OLS Regression to test the said hypotheses. From there, use your regression model to create a prediction and compare these predictions to your actual values using a residual plot. This will allow you to validate your claims from Step 4 and present your findings with credibility.

### Step 6: Presentation ###
Now, we have the code. Present your findings during the Final Presentations on 4/24, and do so in less than 3 minutes. Please be concise with everything so everyone has time to present. You do not have to go too much in depth, you just have to explain your data and the conclusions that can be drawn, as well as the process you went through to reach your conclusions.

### Final Remarks ###
I hope you all enjoyed Tamid Tech Edu. I've had so much fun teaching you guys, and it was an honor. For those of you guys who plan on taking CMSC320, you are more than welcome to use my content as a reference. Thank you guys for being great students, and I wish you all the best of luck in your future endeavors.
