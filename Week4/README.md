# Homework 3 #
***Due April 6th at Midnight***

So now, you have set up your IDE and collected your data. You put all your data on a live database, and imported it onto your Python program. Now you have a CSV file with your data, which must be processed on your machine. What is the next step? Now we must **learn** about what is in our dataframe. This is probably the easiest homework of the semester.

## Step 0: Setup ##
1. Update the repo with everyone's current changes by running ```git pull``` while in the Tamid-TechEdu-S22 directory.
2. Run ```cd Week4``` in that same folder, and then you should be in our Week4 folder for this class.
Now make a .ipynb file using the usual naming convention (name-week4.ipynb).

## Step 1: Collection ##
We did the whole database thing already, so we will put it to rest until the final.
1. Download a dataset off of [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](Kaggle).
2. Extract the CSV file from the downloaded zip file, and move that to your Week 4 directory.

## Step 2: Making and Analyzing the DataFrame ##
Import your necessary libraries before continuing with the steps.
1. Print the dataframe.
2. Access columns as a list and save it as a variable. (HINT: Use ```df.columns```)
3. Create a Crosstab between 2 columns.
4. Check the datatypes of each column.
5. Use df.loc however you want in one line of code. I should expect to see a smaller variant of your dataframe as output.
6. Use the variable you made in step 2 and convert it to an array.
7. Make a boxplot with 2 numerical columns.

## Step 3: Submission ##
Same steps as usual.
1. ```git add filename.ipynb``` to add your file to your local git branch. **Be sure to include both the ipynb and CSV files!!!!!** 
2. ```git commit -m "Message"``` to merge it onto the repo's main branch.
3. ```git push``` to push your changes to the main branch.

Remember to use ```git pull``` if your terminal is saying your changes are out of date.

Slack Sam or I if you have any questions. Good luck and enjoy the simpler assignment!
